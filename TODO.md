#To-do

---

###High Priority

* Set up sample app so it's ready to be theoretically published on jQuery's website
* Add unit testing with QUnit 

###Medium Priority

* Add tutorial for publishing plugins
* Make a more useful example plugin that demonstrates some good jQuery practices

###Low Priority

* Strip out the useful but perhaps un-needed stuff like Bootstrap
